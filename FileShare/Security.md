# Security Considerations

## 1. Private Network Communication using Private Endpoint only

- VNet Peering ensures that all communication between the two offices remains within Azureâ€™s private network, reducing exposure to the public internet. Additionally, we are using Private EndPoint Services which ensures Storage Accounts accessed only internally through endpoint DNS.

## 2. Identity and Access Management

- We use Azure Active Directory (AAD) to manage access to resources.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used for additional security.

## 3. Network Security Groups (NSGs)

- NSGs control inbound and outbound traffic. Our configured rules only permit necessary traffic between the US and EU subnets, and block any other connections by default.

## 4. Monitoring and Logging

- Used **Log Analytics** for real-time monitoring and logging of network traffic, authentication attempts, and encryption statuses.

As an example, File Share performance from US region user is monitored and shown on performance dashboard. Other metrics can be added as needed.

## 5. FileShare Access using Private EndPoint and DNS Records

The secure connection between File share goes through Private Endpoint which is resolved through private DNS records for US region internal file access.

### **Network Access disabled**

Direct Access of Storage is disabled. It can only be accessed using Private Endpoint by resources in the same VNET or peered VNET.
